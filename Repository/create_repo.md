* There will be two types of repositories:1.Public 2.Private. Usually we create *Public* repository as it will be accessible easily. 

##### First time users config settings ,Prior to using git for the first time, run

>git config --global user.email "email-id"
>git config --global user.name  "Your Name"

Replace the email and name strings with your email address and name. If you have not run these commands, then the very first git commit will fail and tell you to run them.
