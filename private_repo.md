>Making a repository private

If you're using GitHub Free, private repositories owned by a personal account may have up to three collaborators. If you have added more than three other users as repository collaborators, you'll need to reduce the number of collaborators to three or fewer before making the repository private, or upgrade to GitHub Pro.

If you're using GitHub Free and change a repository's visibility from public to private, you'll lose access to features like protected branches and GitHub Pages. Any published GitHub Pages site will be automatically unpublished.

If you change a repository's visibility from internal to private, forks that belong to any user without access to the newly private repository are removed.
