# Checking out branch

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **git checkout** command lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch. Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch.

Having new branch for each feature makes your work very easy.It makes you work on many unrelated features at the same time.Moreover branches also facilitate several collaborative workflows.

You can enter command `git branch` and hit enter button.List of available branches in the current repository will appear.

![here is screenshot of branches created by me in my repository:](https://github.com/prajaktavpendse/projectpractice/blob/master/Images/git_branch.PNG)

As we can see in the screenshot,I have created two branches here namely checkout and cloning_forking

Now if you want to checkout the branch then hit command `git checkout <branch name>`
