# Use of Tab Key to complete file path

Do you use the command prompt on a daily basis? If so, use of *tab* key will make your life easier.

When typing in long path names, simply type in the first few letters and then press TAB to autocomplete either folder or file names

I would just need to type in C:\U and then press the TAB key.
