# Repository URLs

There are two easy ways to access remote repository

1. via HTTP
2. via SSH

HTTP is an easy way to allow read-only access to repository.

`http://host/path/to/repo.git`

But you can not push commits to read-only repository.For read-write access you should use SSH.

`ssh://user@host/path/to/repo.git`
