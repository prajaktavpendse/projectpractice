# What is Git Remote ?

The **git remote** command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. Remote connections are more like bookmarks rather than direct links into other repositories. Instead of providing real-time access to another repository, they serve as convenient names that can be used to reference a not-so-convenient URL.

For example, the following diagram shows two remote connections from your repo into the central repo and another developerâ€™s repo. Instead of referencing them by their full URLs, you can pass the origin and john shortcuts to other Git commands.
