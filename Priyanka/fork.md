FORKING IN GIT

Forking means copying the repository. Using fork to a repository you will be able to freely experiment changes without disturbing the original problem. They are used when you want to change someone else project or to use other projects as a starting point for you. To enable fork go to your profile. Then on the left side under organizations choose your organization. Then under repository forking select allow forking of private repositories. Forked repository will always be monitored and compared unlike the cloned repositories.

A great example of using forks to propose changes is for bug fixes. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:

- Fork the repository.
- Make the fix.
- Submit a pull request to the project owner.

If the project owner likes your work, they might pull your fix into the original repository.
