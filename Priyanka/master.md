MASTER BRANCHING

A branch is essentially is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch â€” the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, and is called master.

In Git, "master" is a naming convention for a branch. After cloning (downloading) a project from a remote server, the resulting local repository has a single local branch: the so-called "master" branch. This means that "master" can be seen as a repository's "default" branch.

- In the GitHub Desktop client, switch to the branch you want to merge the development branch into. From the branch selector, select the master branch.
- Go to Branch > Merge into Current Branch.
- In the merge window, select the development branch, and then click Merge development into master.
