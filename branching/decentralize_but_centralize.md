# Decentralize but centralize

Don't get confuse by title.Let me explaain you how it works.It's pretty easy!

![Centralize Branching](https://github.com/prajaktavpendse/projectpractice/blob/master/Images/Centralized_branch.PNG)

Repository setup that works well with this branching is something called "Centralized Repository".It is popularly known as "Origin" among git users.


As shown in the diagram, developer can pulls and pushes to origin. Apart from these centralize push-pull relationships developers can also pull changes from other peers to form sub-teams.

For example, In above figure ,two or more developers are working on same feature under one big project.Before pushing permanent changes to Origin developers can share their repositories among themselves.This way developers can work together and once code is ready for release ,they can push it to the origin.

Hence collaborative work needs *Branches*.
