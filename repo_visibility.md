When creating a repository, you can choose to make it public or private.*Public* repositories are accessible to everyone using GitHub.com, while *private* repositories are accessible to you and the people you share them with.

Repository owners, people with admin permissions for an organization-owned repository, and organization owners can change a repository's visibility.
