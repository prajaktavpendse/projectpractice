# What is **Github Repository**?

  **Github Repository** is a repository is like a folder for your project. Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's revision history. You can also discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

  >How to create a new Github Repository?

* Open github.com

* Create your account

* Once you create your account you will login and see *New Repository* option there.

* There will be two types of repositories:1.Public 2.Private. Usually we create *Public* repository as it will be accessible easily. 

##### First time users config settings ,Prior to using git for the first time, run

>git config --global user.email "email-id"
>git config --global user.name  "Your Name"

Replace the email and name strings with your email address and name. If you have not run these commands, then the very first git commit will fail and tell you to run them.

> About repository visibility
When creating a repository, you can choose to make it public or private.*Public* repositories are accessible to everyone using GitHub.com, while *private* repositories are accessible to you and the people you share them with.

Repository owners, people with admin permissions for an organization-owned repository, and organization owners can change a repository's visibility.

>Making a repository private

If you're using GitHub Free, private repositories owned by a personal account may have up to three collaborators. If you have added more than three other users as repository collaborators, you'll need to reduce the number of collaborators to three or fewer before making the repository private, or upgrade to GitHub Pro.

If you're using GitHub Free and change a repository's visibility from public to private, you'll lose access to features like protected branches and GitHub Pages. Any published GitHub Pages site will be automatically unpublished.

If you change a repository's visibility from internal to private, forks that belong to any user without access to the newly private repository are removed.

##### Steps to create private repository

2. Under your repository name, click Settings .
