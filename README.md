* About project

     Our project is about the various features on how to use github extensively .

     **Github** term is a website based file/projects maintenance service used by developers where they can store and share their code with other fellow developers instead of e-mailing heavy projects files every time.
     Github can also use to create a replica of other open projects into your github's profile which is called as forking. Github can also be used as a Social Networking hub for developers where they can follow other developers, look out their piece of work and can also contribute to them. And few more things can be done with Github.
