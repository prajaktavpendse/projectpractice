#What is forking?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A **fork** is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

The Forking Workflow is fundamentally different than other popular Git workflows. Instead of using a single server-side repository to act as the “central” codebase, it gives every developer their own server-side repository.This means that each contributor has not one, but two Git repositories: a private local one and a public server-side one. The Forking Workflow is most often seen in public open source projects.

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

Steps to use forking feature :

1. Fork the repository.

2. Make the fix.

3. Submit a pull request to the project owner.
