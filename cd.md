# 'cd' command

### 'cd' is one of the most common and basic command used on Linux.The primary purpose of the command is to alter the current directory. In simple words, its primary goal is to shift users to a new location in the file system. So, programmers can use ‘cd’ to change to a directory that is within the current directory. Users are required to type cd and the name of the other directory. For example, to go to the directory named ‘office,’ users can type - cd office.

### In case user wants to move to a filesystem then he can hit the following command:

`cd /usr/local/doc`
